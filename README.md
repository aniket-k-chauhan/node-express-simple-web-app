# Simple Web Application
This is a simple web application created using Node.js and Express.js. Purpose of creating this application is to understand concepts of Node.js/Express.js which are used to build web app.

The concepts I have used to build this web app is listed below:
- Routing: for all three routes: Home, About and API
- Middleware: for API route to fetch data
- Template Engine(Pug): to create HTML Template for each page and make it content-dynamic
- Error Handling

Steps to run it locally:
  1. clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/aniket-k-chauhan/promact-week-1-assignment-1`
  2. install packges using: `npm i`
  3. run application using: `node index.js`
 
Here is the live running [app](https://simple-nodejs-expressjs-web-app.vercel.app/).
